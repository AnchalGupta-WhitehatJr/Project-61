        <p>
            Motu is a plump man who serves as one of the central protagonists of this show. He likes to eat samosas which increase his power drastically, giving him the ability to defeat his normally superior rivals. Samosas also increase his speed, strength, vision, and intelligence, also allowing him to lift boulders and vehicles. Motu's best friend is Patlu. He often lands in trouble because of his actions. He is always looking for the easiest way to earn money, have fun and to eat a lot of samosas. Sometimes he gets over-expressive while celebrating his victory and can do something very foolish, like bringing back a pirate into the present who they had sent back to the past. He is also shown bragging about things he has never done. He is a good-natured man who wants to help others, unfortunately he can be easily fooled by them too, especially John. Patlu once said that he is not a fool, he is a simple man. Although he is not skilled in any job, he tries to work with Patlu as constables, ward boys, cleaners, delivery boys, etc. but he creates troubles and gets fired from those companies/organizations in which he and Patlu worked. He has baldness on his head but has hair next to his ears. He also has a mustache. He wears a red tunic with a blue (mostly black) vest, yellow pajamas and shoes. His talking accent is influenced by Dara Singh. He is depicted as extremely afraid of mice. In the movie, Motu Patlu in Alien World, he was separated from his father when he was 6â€“7 years old. His father is believed to have been abducted by aliens from the planet Axar during his search for extraterrestrial life forms in the universe. His dialogue is "Khaali pet mere dimaag ki batti nahi chalti tum hi kuch karo!" which means "You do something, I can't think on an empty stomach!".</p>

        <p> Patlu is a slim man who serves as one of the show's central protagonists. He is often portrayed as the smartest guy in the city however, he often gets into a lot of trouble with Motu. He dislikes samosas but likes to read the newspapers. It is also believed that his grandfather was a boxing champion and had a recipe for procuring extraordinary strength. This is later discovered to be the case by Motu. He is not strong. He can beat John when he is alone but is beaten by strong criminals or John's goons, especially Number 1. He has a bald head and a braid. He wears a yellow tunic with orange leggings, brown-framed glasses, and brown shoes. His dialogues are " Idea!" and "Motu kuch karo!" ("Motu, do something!," he says it whenever Motu causes troubles.)</p>
